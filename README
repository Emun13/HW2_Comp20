Name of business or organization:
 - Mental Mentality

What they do
 - This non-profit organization that I made up is supposed to help people deal
with various mental health issues. The specifics are described in more detail
on the services page of my website. 


What is their target demographic
 - The target demographic is for anyone wanting help with their mental health.
Although my website/organization is supposed to help anyone with their mental
disorder, I originally designed it to help people with anxiety and depression.
However, there are so components that are more versatile so it will reach 
a larger audience regardless of race/gender/age.


What was the easiest part of this assignment?
 - The easiest part of the assignment, compared to everything else, was just
coming up with the idea of my organization. This was something I had in mind
for a while and wanted to create an app or website, however, I never had any
experience with CSS or HTML. Also, after class I understood the general 
syntax, for example the difference between common tags. This made it easy to
specify my questions when I had to look it up.

What was the most challenging part of this assignment?
 - The general layout of the website was extremely difficult for me. Since 
I never coded in CSS or HTML before, I had lots of trouble getting things to
format correctly on the webpage. I would spend hours to figure out why my 
background image wasn't uploading, and they when it did, why was it pushing all
my text down. It was really frustrating to get the layout I wanted but after 
much research I found the website https://www.w3schools.com very helpful with
answering some of my basic questions. Other things required lots of trial and 
error.
